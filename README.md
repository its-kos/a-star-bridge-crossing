# A* algorithm

This is a java project that implements the A* algorithm, solving the bridge crossing problem. A description of the problem can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_and_torch_problem)

This was a project I developed for a University AI/ML class.

## Problem

In our version of the problem, you must safely navigate a family of however many people you choose across a bridge. Each person has a different speed and only 2 people can cross the brisdge at any give time.

In addition, to cross the bridge, one person crossing must hold a torch that has a set time of life. We must find the optimal way of people crossing the bridge.

## Usage

You must first build the project, then set any parameters you want inside the Main.java file (These should be passed as arguments to the program but its not implemented this way yet).

You will see the optimal way to move family members across printed in your terminal.
